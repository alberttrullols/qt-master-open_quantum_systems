# Open Quantum Systems - Dephasing Studies

This repository contains Julia simulations for studying dephasing effects in open quantum systems, particularly focusing on two-level systems (qubits).

## Description

The project implements quantum master equation simulations to study:
- Pure dephasing effects on different initial quantum states
- Rabi oscillations under dephasing
- Time evolution of quantum states in dissipative environments
